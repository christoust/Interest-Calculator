# Money Interest Calculator

This program calculates the interest on a principal amount for a given time period. It demonstrates the following concepts:

- **Variables**: Uses `let`, `var`, and `const` to store values such as the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.
- **Modules**: Imports the `calculateInterest` function from the `interestCalculator.js` module using `import`.
- **Promises**: Uses promises to handle asynchronous operations when calculating interest.
- **Async/Await**: Uses `async` functions and `await` expressions to work with promises in a synchronous-like manner.

## Features

- Calculate interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.
- Demonstrates modern JavaScript concepts such as ES6 syntax and asynchronous programming.
